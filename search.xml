                <title>Unexpectedly high early prevalence of anaemia in 6-month-old breast-fed
                    infants in rural Bangladesh.</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of anaemia and maternal and
                    infant factors associated with Hb values in infants at 6 months of age in rural
                    Bangladesh. DESIGN: Infants (born to mothers supplemented with Fe-folic acid
                    from mid-pregnancy) were visited at birth and 6 months of age. Mothers'
                    anthropometric status, and infants' birth weight, gestational age at birth,
                    weight and Hb concentration at 6 months were measured. Household socio-economic
                    and demographic data, infant feeding practices and health status were collected
                    using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. SETTING: Rural Bangladesh.
                    SUBJECTS: Four hundred and two infants. RESULTS: For the total cohort (n 402),
                    the range of anaemia prevalence values was from 30.6 % using a cut-off value of
                    Hb &lt; 95 g/l to 71.9 % using a value of Hb &lt; 110 g/l. Birth weight
                    and month of birth were the only factors positively associated with infant Hb in
                    a linear regression model (P = 0.008 and 0.011, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
                    There was an unexpectedly high prevalence of anaemia in infants at 6 months of
                    age, before the assumed period of vulnerability. Hb at this age tended to be
                    higher in those with higher birth weight. We also found a season effect on Hb,
                    as it tended to be higher as the study progressed. The high prevalence of
                    anaemia at such an early age needs to be addressed to minimize the disease's
                    long-term consequences.</description>

                <title>Does the Recommendation to Use a Pacifier Influence the Prevalence of
                    Breastfeeding?</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the recommendation to offer a pacifier
                    once lactation is well established reduces the prevalence or duration of
                    breastfeeding. STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority,
                    controlled trial comprising 1021 mothers highly motivated to breastfeed whose
                    newborns regained birth weight by 15 days. They were assigned to offer versus
                    not to offer pacifiers. Primary outcome was prevalence of exclusive
                    breastfeeding at 3 months. Main secondary outcomes were the prevalence of
                    exclusive and any breastfeeding at different ages and duration of any
                    breastfeeding. RESULTS: At 3 months, 85.8% infants in the offer pacifier group
                    and 86.2% in the not offer pacifier group were exclusively breastfeeding (risk
                    difference, 0.4%; 95% CI, -4.9%-4.1%), satisfying the pre-specified
                    non-inferiority requirement of -7%. Furthermore, the recommendation to offer a
                    pacifier did not produce a significant decrease in the frequency of exclusive
                    and any breastfeeding at different ages or in the duration of lactation.
                    CONCLUSIONS: The recommendation to offer a pacifier at 15 days does not modify
                    the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding. Because pacifier use is associated
                    with reduced incidence of sudden infant death syndrome, the recommendation to
                    offer a pacifier appears safe and appropriate in similar
                    populations.</description>

                <title>Epidemiology of breast cancer subtypes in two prospective cohort studies of
                    breast cancer survivors.</title>
                <description>ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe breast
                    tumor subtypes by common breast cancer risk factors and to determine correlates
                    of subtypes using baseline data from two pooled prospective breast cancer
                    studies within a large health maintenance organization. METHODS: Tumor data on
                    2,544 invasive breast cancer cases subtyped by estrogen receptor, progesterone
                    receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu) status were
                    obtained (1,868 luminal A tumors, 294 luminal B tumors, 288 triple negative
                    tumors and 94 Her2/neu-overexpressing tumors). Demographic, reproductive and
                    lifestyle information was collected either through in-person or mailed
                    questionnaires. Case-only odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
                    were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for age at diagnosis,
                    race/ethnicity and study origin. RESULTS: Compared to luminal A cases, luminal B
                    cases were more likely to be younger at diagnosis (P trend = 0.0001) and were
                    less likely to consume alcohol (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.56-0.98), use hormone
                    replacement therapy (HRT) (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.46-0.94), and oral
                    contraceptives (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.96). Compared to luminal A cases,
                    triple negative cases tended to be younger at diagnosis (P trend less than or
                    equal to 0.0001) and African American (OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 2.12-4.16), were more
                    likely to have not breastfed if they had parity greater than or equal to 3 (OR =
                    1.68, 95% CI: 1.00-2.81), and were more likely to be overweight (OR = 1.82, 95%
                    CI: 1.03-3.24) or obese (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.03-3.77) if premenopausal.
                    Her2-overexpressing cases were more likely to be younger at diagnosis (P trend =
                    0.03) and Hispanic (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.16-4.13) or Asian (OR = 2.02, 95% CI:
                    1.05-3.88), and less likely to use HRT (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.26-0.79).
                    CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that investigators should consider tumor
                    heterogeneity in associations with traditional breast cancer risk factors.
                    Important modifiable lifestyle factors that may be related to the development of
                    a specific tumor subtype, but not all subtypes, include obesity, breastfeeding
                    and alcohol consumption. Future work that will further categorize triple
                    negative cases into basal and non-basal tumors may help to elucidate these
                    associations further.</description>

                <title>Systematic Review: The Role of Breastfeeding in the Development of Pediatric
                    Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVES: To assess the current evidence for the role of
                    breastfeeding in the development of early onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
                    with a systematic review. STUDY DESIGN: An electronic database search was
                    performed (January 1966-January 2008) with keywords related to IBD and
                    breastfeeding, looking specifically for studies that reported outcome in
                    early-onset disease (&lt;16 years of age) and "any exposure" to breast milk
                    as the variables. Meta-analysis of studies included for review was then
                    performed by using a random effects model, and results were expressed as odds
                    ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 79 articles were identified, 20 of
                    which were found describing breastfeeding in relation to the development of IBD;
                    8 of these articles included separate early-onset groups. One study did not
                    describe "any exposure" to breast milk for the early onset group, so 7 studies
                    were included in the meta-analysis. Breast milk exposure had a significant
                    protective effect (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.94; P = .02) in developing
                    early-onset IBD. A non-significant difference was demonstrated for ulcerative
                    colitis and Crohn's disease individually (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.51-1.02; P = .06;
                    OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.38-1.07; P = .09, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The current
                    evidence demonstrates a possible protective effect for breast milk in the
                    development of early onset IBD. However, the quality of existing data is
                    generally poor. These findings need to be investigated in well-designed
                    prospective studies.</description>

                <title>MotherSafe: review of three years of counselling by an Australian Teratology
                    Information Service.</title>
                <description>BACKGROUND: MotherSafe was established in January 2000 at the Royal
                    Hospital for Women as Australia's first 'purpose-built' Teratogen Information
                    Service and since then has received over 75,000 calls regarding exposures during
                    pregnancy and lactation. AIM: To describe the patterns of use of MotherSafe over
                    a three-year period. METHODS: Retrospective descriptive epidemiological study
                    using data from the database established at MotherSafe. Records from all the
                    calls logged at MotherSafe between January 2005 and December 2007 were analysed
                    to determine total number of calls, demographic characteristics of callers,
                    including age, caller category and postcode, reason for call, source of referral
                    and type of exposure. RESULTS: A total of 47,138 calls were recorded to the
                    MotherSafe service from January 2005 to December 2007. The majority of calls
                    were regarding exposures in pregnancy (55%) and breast-feeding (38%). Average
                    age of patients was 32.3 years. Of the calls made, 81.9% (38,485 of 46,968) were
                    by consumers (the pregnant or lactating woman herself or a relative). The most
                    common primary exposure categories were: over-the-counter medications (11.3%),
                    psychotropic medication (9.0%), herbal or vitamin products (8.2%), antibiotics
                    (7.0%), gastrointestinal medications (6.8%) and topical products (6.6%). Forty
                    per cent of callers enquired about multiple exposures. CONCLUSIONS: The
                    utilisation of MotherSafe by consumers and general practitioners continues to
                    increase, reflecting the strong demand for a teratogen counselling service that
                    provides high-quality, evidence-based information on exposures during pregnancy
                    and lactation.</description>

                <title>Newborn Individual Development Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP): A
                    Systematic Review of the Literature.</title>
                <description>Background: Important advancements have been made in the care of
                    preterm infants. Health services have introduced various methods aimed at
                    promoting attachment, breastfeeding, and neurological development. The Newborn
                    Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP), developed to
                    stimulate preterm infants at levels adapted to the child's degree of
                    neurological maturity, is increasingly being used. Objectives: The aim was to
                    investigate the impact of NIDCAP on the psychomotor development, neurological
                    status, medical/nursing care outcomes, and parental perceptions. A further aim
                    was to evaluate the cost-related effects of NIDCAP. Data Extraction and
                    Analysis: A literature search up to September 2007 was performed. The reviewed
                    papers were assessed for methodological quality and only statistically
                    significant findings were extracted. Findings: The evidence compiled on the
                    effects of NIDCAP is based on 12 articles from six randomized controlled trials
                    that included approximately 250 children. Each of the studies was assessed as
                    having medium quality. Most of the studies were small and many investigated a
                    huge number of outcome variables, which decreased their scientific strength. On
                    outcome variables in which a significant difference was found between the
                    intervention (NIDCAP) and control groups, most studies showed better results for
                    the NIDCAP group. This was particularly valid for cognitive and psychomotor
                    development. Four studies also showed a reduced need for respiratory support for
                    the NIDCAP group. No studies were identified that weighed the total cost of
                    NIDCAP against its effects. Conclusions: Despite promising findings, primarily
                    on cognitive and motor development, the scientific evidence on the effects of
                    NIDCAP is limited. Shortcomings in design and methods in the reviewed studies
                    hamper far-reaching claims on the effectiveness of the method. Scientific
                    grounds for assessing the effects of NIDCAP would be substantially enhanced by a
                    sufficiently comprehensive study with extended follow-up and a clear focus on a
                    few important outcome variables.</description>

                    Year of Age in Sub-Saharan Africa With Maternal Use of Highly Active
                    Antiretroviral Therapy During Breast-Feeding.</title>
                <description>BACKGROUND:: Reduction of HIV-1 breast-feeding transmission remains a
                    challenge for prevention of pediatric infections in Sub-Saharan Africa.
                    Provision of formula decreases transmission but often increases child mortality
                    in this setting. METHODS:: A prospective observational cohort study of HIV-1
                    exposed infants of mothers receiving pre and postnatal medical care at Drug
                    Resource Enhancement Against AIDS and Malnutrition centers in Mozambique was
                    conducted. Live-born infants of HIV-1-infected women receiving medical care were
                    enrolled. HIV-1 testing was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months of age using
                    branched DNA. Mothers were counseled to breast-feed exclusively for 6 months and
                    were provided HAART antenatally and postnatally for the first 6 months. Women
                    with CD4 cell counts less than 350/cmm at baseline continued HAART indefinitely.
                    RESULTS:: Of 341 infants followed from birth, 313 mother-infant pairs (92%)
                    completed 6 months and 283 (83%) completed 12 months of follow-up. HIV-1
                    diagnosis was ascertained in 287 infants (84%) including 4 who died. There were
                    8 cases of HIV-1 transmission: 4 of 341 (1.2%) at 1 month, 2 of 313 (0.6%) at 6
                    months, and 2 of 276 (0.7%) at 12 months (cumulative rate: 2.8%). Two mothers
                    (0.6%) and 11 infants (3.2%) died. Maternal and infant mortality rates were 587
                    of 100,000 and 33 of 1000, while country rates are 1000 of 100,000 and 101 of
                    1000. HIV risk reduction was 93% and HIV-free survival at 12 months was 94%.
                    CONCLUSIONS:: Late postnatal transmission of HIV-1 is significantly decreased by
                    maternal use of HAART with high infant survival rates up to 12 months of
                    age.</description>

                <title>Determinants of allergic signs and symptoms in 24- 48-month-old Turkish
                    children.</title>
                <description>The expression of asthma and allergic diseases depends upon an
                    interaction of genetic and environmental factors and thus may differ between
                    populations. This study was performed to document the factors determining
                    allergic signs and symptoms in early childhood in a group of Turkish children.
                    Children followed at the Well-Baby Clinic who were 2 to 4 years were invited and
                    re-evaluated. In addition to face-to-face questionnaire for allergic signs and
                    symptoms and review of files, skin prick test was performed. The associations
                    between risk factors and different aspects of atopy were analyzed. One hundred
                    and nine patients (mean age: 31.6 +/- 3.5 months) were included in the study.
                    All had been breast-fed with mean exclusive and total breastfeeding durations of
                    3.3 +/- 2.7 and 13.3 +/- 7.2 months, respectively. Eight children had
                    physician-diagnosed allergic diseases (4 atopic eczema, 3 bronchial asthma and 1
                    food allergy) and the overall prevalence of sensitization was 13%. Introduction
                    of cow's milk before 12 months appeared to be a significant risk factor for
                    atopy. Smoking during lactation and having an older sibling showed a trend
                    towards an increase while regular yoghurt consumption showed a trend to decrease
                    the risk for atopy. No significant risk factor could be defined for ever
                    wheezing. It was concluded that in young Turkish children, early introduction of
                    cow's milk, passive smoking and having an older sibling may predict atopy
                    whereas regular yoghurt consumption may decrease the risk of atopy. These
                    results also support the concept that variability may exist between
                    populations.</description>

                <title>Health care providers' perceived role in changing environments to promote
                    healthy eating and physical activity: baseline findings from health care
                    providers participating in the healthy eating, active communities
                    program.</title>
                <description>BACKGROUND: The California Endowment's Healthy Eating, Active
                    Communities program was designed to reduce disparities in the incidence of
                    obesity by improving food and physical-activity environments for low-income
                    children. It was recognized at the outset that to succeed, the program needed
                    support from community advocates. Health care providers can be effective
                    advocates to mobilize community members and influence policy makers. OBJECTIVE:
                    This study was conducted to describe how health care providers address obesity
                    prevention in clinical practice and to assess health care providers' level of
                    readiness to advocate for policies to prevent childhood obesity. METHODS: The
                    study included two data-collection methods, (1) a self-administered survey of
                    health care providers (physicians, dietitians, nurses, nurse practitioners,
                    medical assistants, and community health workers) and (2) stakeholder interviews
                    with health care facility administrators, health department staff, and health
                    insurance organization representatives. Two-hundred and forty-eight health care
                    providers participated in the provider survey and the health care stakeholder
                    interviews were conducted with 56 respondents. RESULTS: The majority (65%) of
                    health care providers usually or always discussed the importance of
                    physical-activity, reducing soda consumption, and breastfeeding (as appropriate)
                    during clinical pediatric visits. More than 90% of the providers perceived home
                    or neighborhood environments and parental resistance as barriers to their
                    efforts to prevent childhood obesity in clinical practice. More than 75% of
                    providers reported not having engaged in any policy/advocacy activities related
                    to obesity-prevention. Most (88%) of the stakeholders surveyed thought that
                    health care professionals should advocate for policies to reduce obesity,
                    especially around insurance coverage for obesity-prevention. CONCLUSIONS:
                    Providers perceived that changing the food and physical-activity environments in
                    neighborhoods and schools was likely to be the most effective way to support
                    their clinical obesity-prevention efforts. Health care providers need time,
                    training, resources, and institutional support to improve their ability to
                    communicate obesity-prevention messages in both clinical practice and as
                    community policy advocates.</description>

                <title>Unexpectedly high early prevalence of anaemia in 6-month-old breast-fed
                    infants in rural Bangladesh.</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of anaemia and maternal and
                    infant factors associated with Hb values in infants at 6 months of age in rural
                    Bangladesh. DESIGN: Infants (born to mothers supplemented with Fe-folic acid
                    from mid-pregnancy) were visited at birth and 6 months of age. Mothers'
                    anthropometric status, and infants' birth weight, gestational age at birth,
                    weight and Hb concentration at 6 months were measured. Household socio-economic
                    and demographic data, infant feeding practices and health status were collected
                    using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. SETTING: Rural Bangladesh.
                    SUBJECTS: Four hundred and two infants. RESULTS: For the total cohort (n 402),
                    the range of anaemia prevalence values was from 30.6 % using a cut-off value of
                    Hb &lt; 95 g/l to 71.9 % using a value of Hb &lt; 110 g/l. Birth weight
                    and month of birth were the only factors positively associated with infant Hb in
                    a linear regression model (P = 0.008 and 0.011, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
                    There was an unexpectedly high prevalence of anaemia in infants at 6 months of
                    age, before the assumed period of vulnerability. Hb at this age tended to be
                    higher in those with higher birth weight. We also found a season effect on Hb,
                    as it tended to be higher as the study progressed. The high prevalence of
                    anaemia at such an early age needs to be addressed to minimize the disease's
                    long-term consequences.</description>

                <title>Does the Recommendation to Use a Pacifier Influence the Prevalence of
                    Breastfeeding?</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the recommendation to offer a pacifier
                    once lactation is well established reduces the prevalence or duration of
                    breastfeeding. STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority,
                    controlled trial comprising 1021 mothers highly motivated to breastfeed whose
                    newborns regained birth weight by 15 days. They were assigned to offer versus
                    not to offer pacifiers. Primary outcome was prevalence of exclusive
                    breastfeeding at 3 months. Main secondary outcomes were the prevalence of
                    exclusive and any breastfeeding at different ages and duration of any
                    breastfeeding. RESULTS: At 3 months, 85.8% infants in the offer pacifier group
                    and 86.2% in the not offer pacifier group were exclusively breastfeeding (risk
                    difference, 0.4%; 95% CI, -4.9%-4.1%), satisfying the pre-specified
                    non-inferiority requirement of -7%. Furthermore, the recommendation to offer a
                    pacifier did not produce a significant decrease in the frequency of exclusive
                    and any breastfeeding at different ages or in the duration of lactation.
                    CONCLUSIONS: The recommendation to offer a pacifier at 15 days does not modify
                    the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding. Because pacifier use is associated
                    with reduced incidence of sudden infant death syndrome, the recommendation to
                    offer a pacifier appears safe and appropriate in similar
                    populations.</description>

                <title>Epidemiology of breast cancer subtypes in two prospective cohort studies of
                    breast cancer survivors.</title>
                <description>ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe breast
                    tumor subtypes by common breast cancer risk factors and to determine correlates
                    of subtypes using baseline data from two pooled prospective breast cancer
                    studies within a large health maintenance organization. METHODS: Tumor data on
                    2,544 invasive breast cancer cases subtyped by estrogen receptor, progesterone
                    receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu) status were
                    obtained (1,868 luminal A tumors, 294 luminal B tumors, 288 triple negative
                    tumors and 94 Her2/neu-overexpressing tumors). Demographic, reproductive and
                    lifestyle information was collected either through in-person or mailed
                    questionnaires. Case-only odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
                    were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for age at diagnosis,
                    race/ethnicity and study origin. RESULTS: Compared to luminal A cases, luminal B
                    cases were more likely to be younger at diagnosis (P trend = 0.0001) and were
                    less likely to consume alcohol (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.56-0.98), use hormone
                    replacement therapy (HRT) (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.46-0.94), and oral
                    contraceptives (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.96). Compared to luminal A cases,
                    triple negative cases tended to be younger at diagnosis (P trend less than or
                    equal to 0.0001) and African American (OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 2.12-4.16), were more
                    likely to have not breastfed if they had parity greater than or equal to 3 (OR =
                    1.68, 95% CI: 1.00-2.81), and were more likely to be overweight (OR = 1.82, 95%
                    CI: 1.03-3.24) or obese (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.03-3.77) if premenopausal.
                    Her2-overexpressing cases were more likely to be younger at diagnosis (P trend =
                    0.03) and Hispanic (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.16-4.13) or Asian (OR = 2.02, 95% CI:
                    1.05-3.88), and less likely to use HRT (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.26-0.79).
                    CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that investigators should consider tumor
                    heterogeneity in associations with traditional breast cancer risk factors.
                    Important modifiable lifestyle factors that may be related to the development of
                    a specific tumor subtype, but not all subtypes, include obesity, breastfeeding
                    and alcohol consumption. Future work that will further categorize triple
                    negative cases into basal and non-basal tumors may help to elucidate these
                    associations further.</description>

                <title>The fertility-related concerns, needs and preferences of younger women with
                    breast cancer: a systematic review.</title>
                <description>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer in
                    reproductive aged women. Adjuvant systemic therapy is recommended in most women
                    and has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of recurrence and increase
                    survival. However, there may be a negative impact of adjuvant systemic therapy
                    on fertility as well as on subsequent quality of life. There are a number of
                    fertility preservation options currently available and relevant information
                    regarding these options should be provided prior to commencing adjuvant
                    treatment. The aim of the review is to identify the fertility-related needs,
                    concerns and preferences of young women with early breast cancer. The databases
                    MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1988 onwards using keywords, and examining
                    reference lists. Of the 499 articles identified, 20 met eligibility criteria and
                    were reviewed. Multiple fertility-related information needs specific to this
                    group regarding menstrual changes and potential infertility attitudes to, and
                    actual decisions made regarding, pregnancy breastfeeding and contraception
                    emerged. Information on fertility-related decisions was rated as important, and
                    the preferred methods for obtaining this information was consultation with a
                    specialist or a decision aid early in the treatment plan. There is limited
                    research about fertility-related needs, and even less on contraceptive
                    preferences and the attitudes of health care providers towards fertility-related
                    issues. No studies describing the development of tools to assist with decisions
                    about fertility-related choices were identified. Young women with early breast
                    cancer have specific fertility- and menopause-related needs and concerns, which
                    are commonly not adequately addressed or discussed prior to commencing adjuvant
                    therapy.</description>

                <title>Pacifiers and breastfeeding: a systematic review.</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVE: To summarize current evidence on the association between
                    infant pacifier use and breastfeeding. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, the
                    Cochrane Library, EMBASE, POPLINE, and bibliographies of identified articles.
                    STUDY SELECTION: A search for English-language records (from January 1950
                    through August 2006) containing the Medical Subject Heading terms pacifiers and
                    breastfeeding was conducted, resulting in 1098 reports. Duplicate and irrelevant
                    studies were excluded, yielding 29 studies that fit inclusion criteria for the
                    review (4 randomized controlled trials, 20 cohort studies, and 5 cross-sectional
                    studies). Two independent reviewers abstracted data and scored these studies for
                    quality; disagreements were settled through consensus with a third investigator.
                    MAIN EXPOSURE: Pacifier use. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Breastfeeding duration or
                    exclusivity. RESULTS: Results from 4 randomized controlled trials revealed no
                    difference in breastfeeding outcomes with different pacifier interventions
                    (pacifier use during tube feeds, pacifier use at any time after delivery, an
                    educational program for mothers emphasizing avoidance of pacifiers, and a UNICEF
                    [United Nations Children's Fund]/World Health Organization Baby Friendly
                    Hospital environment). Most observational studies reported an association
                    between pacifier use and shortened duration of breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: The
                    highest level of evidence does not support an adverse relationship between
                    pacifier use and breastfeeding duration or exclusivity. The association between
                    shortened duration of breastfeeding and pacifier use in observational studies
                    likely reflects a number of other complex factors, such as breastfeeding
                    difficulties or intent to wean. Ongoing quantitative and qualitative research is
                    needed to better understand the relationship between pacifier use and
                    breastfeeding.</description>

                <title>The relationship between infant-feeding outcomes and postpartum depression: a
                    qualitative systematic review.</title>
                <description>CONTEXT: The negative health consequences of postpartum depression are
                    well documented, as are the benefits of breastfeeding. Despite the detailed
                    research related to these maternal and infant health outcomes, the relationship
                    between maternal mood and breastfeeding remains equivocal. OBJECTIVE: A
                    qualitative systematic review was conducted to examine the relationship between
                    postpartum depressive symptomatology and infant-feeding outcomes. METHODS: We
                    performed electronic searchers in Medline (1966-2007), the Cumulative Index to
                    Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982-2007), and Embase
                    (1980-2007) by using specific key words. A hand search of selected specialist
                    journals and reference lists of articles obtained was then conducted.
                    Seventy-five articles were reviewed, of which 49 specifically provided data to
                    be extracted related to postpartum depressive symptomatology and infant-feeding
                    outcomes. Both authors independently extracted data including study design,
                    participants (number and characteristics), and results. RESULTS: The results
                    from this review suggest that women with depressive symptomatology in the early
                    postpartum period may be at increased risk for negative infant-feeding outcomes
                    including decreased breastfeeding duration, increased breastfeeding
                    difficulties, and decreased levels of breastfeeding self-efficacy. There is also
                    beginning evidence to suggest that depressed women may be less likely to
                    initiate breastfeeding and do so exclusively. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive
                    symptomatology in the postpartum period negatively influences infant-feeding
                    outcomes. These findings have important clinical implications and support the
                    need for early identification and treatment of women with depressive
                    symptomatology. However, strategies to address help-seeking barriers are needed
                    if women are to receive appropriate and timely treatment. Research to determine
                    effective interventions to support depressed breastfeeding women is
                    warranted.</description>

                <title>Systematic Review: The Role of Breastfeeding in the Development of Pediatric
                    Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVES: To assess the current evidence for the role of
                    breastfeeding in the development of early onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
                    with a systematic review. STUDY DESIGN: An electronic database search was
                    performed (January 1966-January 2008) with keywords related to IBD and
                    breastfeeding, looking specifically for studies that reported outcome in
                    early-onset disease (&lt;16 years of age) and "any exposure" to breast milk
                    as the variables. Meta-analysis of studies included for review was then
                    performed by using a random effects model, and results were expressed as odds
                    ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 79 articles were identified, 20 of
                    which were found describing breastfeeding in relation to the development of IBD;
                    8 of these articles included separate early-onset groups. One study did not
                    describe "any exposure" to breast milk for the early onset group, so 7 studies
                    were included in the meta-analysis. Breast milk exposure had a significant
                    protective effect (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.94; P = .02) in developing
                    early-onset IBD. A non-significant difference was demonstrated for ulcerative
                    colitis and Crohn's disease individually (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.51-1.02; P = .06;
                    OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.38-1.07; P = .09, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The current
                    evidence demonstrates a possible protective effect for breast milk in the
                    development of early onset IBD. However, the quality of existing data is
                    generally poor. These findings need to be investigated in well-designed
                    prospective studies.</description>

                <title>Newborn Individual Development Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP): A
                    Systematic Review of the Literature.</title>
                <description>Background: Important advancements have been made in the care of
                    preterm infants. Health services have introduced various methods aimed at
                    promoting attachment, breastfeeding, and neurological development. The Newborn
                    Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP), developed to
                    stimulate preterm infants at levels adapted to the child's degree of
                    neurological maturity, is increasingly being used. Objectives: The aim was to
                    investigate the impact of NIDCAP on the psychomotor development, neurological
                    status, medical/nursing care outcomes, and parental perceptions. A further aim
                    was to evaluate the cost-related effects of NIDCAP. Data Extraction and
                    Analysis: A literature search up to September 2007 was performed. The reviewed
                    papers were assessed for methodological quality and only statistically
                    significant findings were extracted. Findings: The evidence compiled on the
                    effects of NIDCAP is based on 12 articles from six randomized controlled trials
                    that included approximately 250 children. Each of the studies was assessed as
                    having medium quality. Most of the studies were small and many investigated a
                    huge number of outcome variables, which decreased their scientific strength. On
                    outcome variables in which a significant difference was found between the
                    intervention (NIDCAP) and control groups, most studies showed better results for
                    the NIDCAP group. This was particularly valid for cognitive and psychomotor
                    development. Four studies also showed a reduced need for respiratory support for
                    the NIDCAP group. No studies were identified that weighed the total cost of
                    NIDCAP against its effects. Conclusions: Despite promising findings, primarily
                    on cognitive and motor development, the scientific evidence on the effects of
                    NIDCAP is limited. Shortcomings in design and methods in the reviewed studies
                    hamper far-reaching claims on the effectiveness of the method. Scientific
                    grounds for assessing the effects of NIDCAP would be substantially enhanced by a
                    sufficiently comprehensive study with extended follow-up and a clear focus on a
                    few important outcome variables.</description>

                <title>The fertility-related concerns, needs and preferences of younger women with
                    breast cancer: a systematic review.</title>
                <description>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer in
                    reproductive aged women. Adjuvant systemic therapy is recommended in most women
                    and has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of recurrence and increase
                    survival. However, there may be a negative impact of adjuvant systemic therapy
                    on fertility as well as on subsequent quality of life. There are a number of
                    fertility preservation options currently available and relevant information
                    regarding these options should be provided prior to commencing adjuvant
                    treatment. The aim of the review is to identify the fertility-related needs,
                    concerns and preferences of young women with early breast cancer. The databases
                    MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1988 onwards using keywords, and examining
                    reference lists. Of the 499 articles identified, 20 met eligibility criteria and
                    were reviewed. Multiple fertility-related information needs specific to this
                    group regarding menstrual changes and potential infertility attitudes to, and
                    actual decisions made regarding, pregnancy breastfeeding and contraception
                    emerged. Information on fertility-related decisions was rated as important, and
                    the preferred methods for obtaining this information was consultation with a
                    specialist or a decision aid early in the treatment plan. There is limited
                    research about fertility-related needs, and even less on contraceptive
                    preferences and the attitudes of health care providers towards fertility-related
                    issues. No studies describing the development of tools to assist with decisions
                    about fertility-related choices were identified. Young women with early breast
                    cancer have specific fertility- and menopause-related needs and concerns, which
                    are commonly not adequately addressed or discussed prior to commencing adjuvant
                    therapy.</description>

                <title>Breastfeeding duration and exclusivity associated with infants' health and
                    growth: data from a prospective cohort study in Bavaria, Germany.</title>
                <description>AIM: To investigate the relationship between breastfeeding and infant
                    health and to describe growth in the first 9 months. METHODS: Mothers delivering
                    a baby in April 2005 were recruited throughout Bavaria, Germany, for a
                    prospective birth cohort study. These mothers reported breastfeeding data,
                    health and growth data of 1901 infants assessed by a physician in questionnaires
                    on day 2-6, and in months 2, 4, 6 and 9. Subjects were healthy term infants with
                    a birth weight &gt; or =2500 g. We compared 475 infants breastfed
                    exclusively for &gt; or =6 months (group A), 870 infants breastfed
                    fully/exclusively &gt; or =4 months, but not exclusively &gt; or =6
                    months (group B) and 619 infants not breastfed/breastfed &lt;4 months (group
                    C). RESULTS: In multivariate analysis &gt; or =6 months of exclusive
                    breastfeeding reduced significantly the risk for &gt; or =1 episode of
                    gastrointestinal infection(s) during months 1-9 compared to no/&lt;4 months
                    breastfeeding (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
                    0.44-0.82). The application of the World Health Organization (WHO)-child growth
                    standards showed lower weight-for-length z-scores in first days of life in group
                    C versus groups A and B, whereas in months 6/7 group C showed the highest
                    scores. CONCLUSION: Differences in child growth depending on breastfeeding
                    duration should be investigated further. Concerning health outcomes our findings
                    support the recommendation for &gt; or =6 months of exclusive
                    breastfeeding.</description>

                <title>Are Starting and Continuing Breastfeeding Related to Educational Background?
                    The Generation R Study.</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVE. To assess the effect of a woman's educational level on
                    starting and continuing breastfeeding and to assess the role of
                    sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, psychosocial, and birth characteristics in
                    this association. METHODS. We used the data of 2914 participants in a
                    population-based prospective cohort study. Information on educational level,
                    breastfeeding, sociodemographic (maternal age, single parenthood, parity, job
                    status), lifestyle-related (BMI, smoking, alcohol use), psychosocial (whether
                    the pregnancy was planned, stress), and birth (gestational age, birth weight,
                    cesarean delivery, place and type of delivery) characteristics were obtained
                    between pregnancy and 12 months postpartum. Odds ratios and 95% confidence
                    intervals of starting and continuing breastfeeding for educational level were
                    obtained by logistic regression, adjusted for each group of covariates and for
                    all covariates simultaneously. RESULTS. Of 1031 highest-educated mothers, 985
                    (95.5%) started breastfeeding; the percentage was 73.1% (255 of 349) in the
                    lowest-educated mothers. At 6 months, 39.3% (405 of 1031) of highest-educated
                    mothers and 15.2% (53 of 349) of lowest-educated mothers were still
                    breastfeeding. Educationally related differences were present in starting
                    breastfeeding and the continuation of breastfeeding until 2 months but not in
                    breastfeeding continuation between 2 and 6 months. Lifestyle-related and birth
                    characteristics attenuated the association between educational level and
                    breastfeeding, but the association was hardly affected by sociodemographic and
                    psychosocial characteristics. CONCLUSIONS. Decisions to breastfeed were
                    underlain by differences in educational background. The underlying pathways
                    require further research. For the time being, interventions on promoting
                    breastfeeding should start early in pregnancy and should increase their focus on
                    low-educated women.</description>

                <title>Which mothers wean their babies prematurely from full breastfeeding? An
                    Australian cohort study.</title>
                <description>Aim: To identify the maternal and infant characteristics associated
                    with an early transition from full breastfeeding to complementary or no
                    breastfeeding during the first 2 months of life in a large, representative
                    cohort of Australian infants. Method: Multinomial logistic modelling was
                    performed on data for infants with complete breastfeeding and sociodemographic
                    data (N = 4679) including maternal age, education, smoking, employment,
                    pregnancy and birth outcomes. Results: Ninety-one percent of women initiated
                    breastfeeding. Sixty-nine percent of infants were being fully breastfed at 1
                    month, and 59% were fully breastfed at 2 months. Maternal characteristics - age
                    less than 25 years, smoking in pregnancy, early full-time postnatal employment
                    and less educational attainment - were associated with early breastfeeding
                    cessation. Infant factors - multiple birth, caesarean birth, infant or first
                    birth - were associated with a transition to complementary breastfeeding in the
                    first postnatal month. Conclusion: Breastfeeding duration is substantially
                    affected by breastfeeding outcomes in the first postpartum month. The first
                    month is an important window for evidence-based interventions to improve rates
                    of full breastfeeding in groups of women identified as at risk of early
                    breastfeeding cessation.</description>

                    a baby in April 2005 were recruited throughout Bavaria, Germany, for a
                    prospective birth cohort study. These mothers reported breastfeeding data,
                    health and growth data of 1901 infants assessed by a physician in questionnaires
                    on day 2-6, and in months 2, 4, 6 and 9. Subjects were healthy term infants with
                    a birth weight &gt; or =2500 g. We compared 475 infants breastfed
                    exclusively for &gt; or =6 months (group A), 870 infants breastfed
                    fully/exclusively &gt; or =4 months, but not exclusively &gt; or =6
                    months (group B) and 619 infants not breastfed/breastfed &lt;4 months (group
                    C). RESULTS: In multivariate analysis &gt; or =6 months of exclusive
                    breastfeeding reduced significantly the risk for &gt; or =1 episode of
                    gastrointestinal infection(s) during months 1-9 compared to no/&lt;4 months
                    breastfeeding (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
                    0.44-0.82). The application of the World Health Organization (WHO)-child growth
                    standards showed lower weight-for-length z-scores in first days of life in group
                    C versus groups A and B, whereas in months 6/7 group C showed the highest
                    scores. CONCLUSION: Differences in child growth depending on breastfeeding
                    duration should be investigated further. Concerning health outcomes our findings
                    support the recommendation for &gt; or =6 months of exclusive
                    breastfeeding.</description>

                <title>Are Starting and Continuing Breastfeeding Related to Educational Background?
                    The Generation R Study.</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVE. To assess the effect of a woman's educational level on
                    starting and continuing breastfeeding and to assess the role of
                    sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, psychosocial, and birth characteristics in
                    this association. METHODS. We used the data of 2914 participants in a
                    population-based prospective cohort study. Information on educational level,
                    breastfeeding, sociodemographic (maternal age, single parenthood, parity, job
                    status), lifestyle-related (BMI, smoking, alcohol use), psychosocial (whether
                    the pregnancy was planned, stress), and birth (gestational age, birth weight,
                    cesarean delivery, place and type of delivery) characteristics were obtained
                    between pregnancy and 12 months postpartum. Odds ratios and 95% confidence
                    intervals of starting and continuing breastfeeding for educational level were
                    obtained by logistic regression, adjusted for each group of covariates and for
                    all covariates simultaneously. RESULTS. Of 1031 highest-educated mothers, 985
                    (95.5%) started breastfeeding; the percentage was 73.1% (255 of 349) in the
                    lowest-educated mothers. At 6 months, 39.3% (405 of 1031) of highest-educated
                    mothers and 15.2% (53 of 349) of lowest-educated mothers were still
                    breastfeeding. Educationally related differences were present in starting
                    breastfeeding and the continuation of breastfeeding until 2 months but not in
                    breastfeeding continuation between 2 and 6 months. Lifestyle-related and birth
                    characteristics attenuated the association between educational level and
                    breastfeeding, but the association was hardly affected by sociodemographic and
                    psychosocial characteristics. CONCLUSIONS. Decisions to breastfeed were
                    underlain by differences in educational background. The underlying pathways
                    require further research. For the time being, interventions on promoting
                    breastfeeding should start early in pregnancy and should increase their focus on
                    low-educated women.</description>

                <title>Epidemiology of breast cancer subtypes in two prospective cohort studies of
                    breast cancer survivors.</title>
                <description>ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe breast
                    tumor subtypes by common breast cancer risk factors and to determine correlates
                    of subtypes using baseline data from two pooled prospective breast cancer
                    studies within a large health maintenance organization. METHODS: Tumor data on
                    2,544 invasive breast cancer cases subtyped by estrogen receptor, progesterone
                    receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu) status were
                    obtained (1,868 luminal A tumors, 294 luminal B tumors, 288 triple negative
                    tumors and 94 Her2/neu-overexpressing tumors). Demographic, reproductive and
                    lifestyle information was collected either through in-person or mailed
                    questionnaires. Case-only odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
                    were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for age at diagnosis,
                    race/ethnicity and study origin. RESULTS: Compared to luminal A cases, luminal B
                    cases were more likely to be younger at diagnosis (P trend = 0.0001) and were
                    less likely to consume alcohol (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.56-0.98), use hormone
                    replacement therapy (HRT) (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.46-0.94), and oral
                    contraceptives (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.96). Compared to luminal A cases,
                    triple negative cases tended to be younger at diagnosis (P trend less than or
                    equal to 0.0001) and African American (OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 2.12-4.16), were more
                    likely to have not breastfed if they had parity greater than or equal to 3 (OR =
                    1.68, 95% CI: 1.00-2.81), and were more likely to be overweight (OR = 1.82, 95%
                    CI: 1.03-3.24) or obese (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.03-3.77) if premenopausal.
                    Her2-overexpressing cases were more likely to be younger at diagnosis (P trend =
                    0.03) and Hispanic (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.16-4.13) or Asian (OR = 2.02, 95% CI:
                    1.05-3.88), and less likely to use HRT (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.26-0.79).
                    CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that investigators should consider tumor
                    heterogeneity in associations with traditional breast cancer risk factors.
                    Important modifiable lifestyle factors that may be related to the development of
                    a specific tumor subtype, but not all subtypes, include obesity, breastfeeding
                    and alcohol consumption. Future work that will further categorize triple
                    negative cases into basal and non-basal tumors may help to elucidate these
                    associations further.</description>

                <title>Operational effectiveness of guidelines on complete breast-feeding cessation
                    to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV: results from a prospective
                    observational cohort study at routine prevention of mother-to-child transmission
                    sites, South Africa.</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVE: Until 2006, HIV-positive women who chose to exclusively
                    breast-feed were advised to completely stop breast-feeding by 6 months. We
                    investigated operational feasibility and predictors of complete breast-feeding
                    cessation (CBC). DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study at 3 routine
                    prevention of mother-to-child transmission sites, South Africa. METHODS: Data on
                    "complete breast-feeding cessation at 24 weeks" and "not breast-feeding (NBF)
                    for 4 days before the last follow-up visit at or before 24 weeks" were gathered
                    during home visits (3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks). The main subgroup of
                    interest for this analysis was women practicing exclusive
                    breast-feeding/predominant breast-feeding at 3 weeks. Univariate analysis,
                    logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis, and Cox regression were
                    performed. RESULTS: Eighty-eight women (43.6%) reported CBC. "Health staff
                    suggesting formula use: [OR(a) 4.39 (1.76-10.97)] and "infant hospitalization"
                    [OR(a) 3.27 (1.37-7.79)] were the only significant predictors of CBC. The
                    probability of NBF at 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks was 2.8% [95% confidence
                    interval (CI) 1.8% to 3.8%], 4.3% (3.0% to 5.6%), 5.9% (4.4% to 7.4%, 9.8% (7.9%
                    to 11.7%), 16.1 (13.8% to 18.4%), 23.1% (20.5% to 25.7%), and 37.6% (34.6% to
                    40.6%), respectively. Infant HIV status [hazard ratio 5.5 95% CI 2.4 to 12.5]
                    was the only predictor of infant death. NBF was not protective against 9-month
                    infant HIV or death in univariate and multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: At
                    programmatic level, CBC by 24 weeks is uncommon, and success seems unrelated to
                    predetermined social, economic, and environmental (acceptable, feasible,
                    affordable, sustainable, and safe AFASS) criteria. Thus at this level,
                    activities that encourage CBC (amongst women meeting AFASS criteria) need to be
                    identified and tested.</description>

                <title>Breast-feeding and adherence to infant feeding guidelines do not influence
                    bone mass at age 4 years.</title>
                <description>The impact of variations in current infant feeding practice on bone
                    mineral accrual is not known. We examined the associations between duration of
                    breast-feeding and compliance with infant dietary guidelines and later bone size
                    and density at age 4 years. At total of 599 (318 boys) mother-child pairs were
                    recruited from the Southampton Women's Survey. Duration of breast-feeding was
                    recorded and infant diet was assessed at 6 and 12 months using FFQ. At 6 and 12
                    months the most important dietary pattern, defined by principal component
                    analysis, was characterised by high consumption of vegetables, fruits and
                    home-prepared foods. As this was consistent with infant feeding recommendations,
                    it was denoted the 'infant guidelines' pattern. At age 4 years, children
                    underwent assessment of whole-body bone size and density using a Hologic
                    Discovery dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry instrument. Correlation methods were
                    used to explore the relationships between infant dietary variables and bone
                    mineral. There was no association between duration of breast-feeding in the
                    first year of life and 4-year bone size or density. 'Infant guidelines' pattern
                    scores at 6 and 12 months were also unrelated to bone mass at age 4 years. We
                    observed wide variations in current infant feeding practice, but these
                    variations were not associated with differences in childhood bone mass at age 4
                    years.</description>

                <description>A central goal of The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine is the
                    development of clinical protocols for managing common medical problems that may
                    impact breastfeeding success. These protocols serve only as guidelines for the
                    care of breastfeeding mothers and infants and do not delineate an exclusive
                    course of treatment or serve as standards of medical care. Variations in
                    treatment may be appropriate according to the needs of an individual
                    patient.</description>

                <title>Weight gain in childhood and blood lipids in adolescence.</title>
                <description>AIM: To assess the effect of weight gain in childhood on blood lipid
                    levels in adolescence. METHODS: A population-based birth cohort carried out in
                    Pelotas, Southern Brazil. All newborns in the city's hospitals were enrolled in
                    1982. The subjects have been followed up for several times in childhood. At age
                    18, 79% of all males were followed, and 2083 blood samples were available.
                    Adjusted analyses controlled for household assets index, family income, parental
                    schooling at birth, maternal smoking during pregnancy and breastfeeding
                    duration. RESULTS: Birth weight for gestational age and weight gain in the first
                    20 months was not associated with blood lipid levels in adolescence. On the
                    other hand, those subjects whose weight gain from 20 to 42 months of age was
                    faster than that predicted from birth weight and weight-for-age z-score at the
                    mean age of 20 months had lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL)
                    cholesterol [-0.78(95% confidence interval: -1.28; -0.29)] and higher very
                    low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein
                    cholesterol (LDL)/HDL ratio in adolescence. After controlling for current body
                    mass index (BMI), the regression coefficient for HDL cholesterol decreased from
                    -0.78 mg/dL to -0.29 mg/dL (95% confidence interval: -1.00 to 0.05). CONCLUSION:
                    Weight gain from 2 to 4 years is related to an atherogenic lipid profile in
                    adolescence and this association is mediated by current BMI.</description>

                <description>AIM: To investigate the relationship between breastfeeding and infant
                    health and to describe growth in the first 9 months. METHODS: Mothers delivering
                    a baby in April 2005 were recruited throughout Bavaria, Germany, for a
                    prospective birth cohort study. These mothers reported breastfeeding data,
                    health and growth data of 1901 infants assessed by a physician in questionnaires
                    on day 2-6, and in months 2, 4, 6 and 9. Subjects were healthy term infants with
                    a birth weight &gt; or =2500 g. We compared 475 infants breastfed
                    exclusively for &gt; or =6 months (group A), 870 infants breastfed
                    fully/exclusively &gt; or =4 months, but not exclusively &gt; or =6
                    months (group B) and 619 infants not breastfed/breastfed &lt;4 months (group
                    C). RESULTS: In multivariate analysis &gt; or =6 months of exclusive
                    breastfeeding reduced significantly the risk for &gt; or =1 episode of
                    gastrointestinal infection(s) during months 1-9 compared to no/&lt;4 months
                    breastfeeding (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
                    0.44-0.82). The application of the World Health Organization (WHO)-child growth
                    standards showed lower weight-for-length z-scores in first days of life in group
                    C versus groups A and B, whereas in months 6/7 group C showed the highest
                    scores. CONCLUSION: Differences in child growth depending on breastfeeding
                    duration should be investigated further. Concerning health outcomes our findings
                    support the recommendation for &gt; or =6 months of exclusive
                    breastfeeding.</description>

                    Resource Enhancement Against AIDS and Malnutrition centers in Mozambique was
                    conducted. Live-born infants of HIV-1-infected women receiving medical care were
                    enrolled. HIV-1 testing was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months of age using
                    branched DNA. Mothers were counseled to breast-feed exclusively for 6 months and
                    were provided HAART antenatally and postnatally for the first 6 months. Women

                    RESULTS:: Of 341 infants followed from birth, 313 mother-infant pairs (92%)
                    completed 6 months and 283 (83%) completed 12 months of follow-up. HIV-1
                    diagnosis was ascertained in 287 infants (84%) including 4 who died. There were
                    8 cases of HIV-1 transmission: 4 of 341 (1.2%) at 1 month, 2 of 313 (0.6%) at 6
                    months, and 2 of 276 (0.7%) at 12 months (cumulative rate: 2.8%). Two mothers
                    (0.6%) and 11 infants (3.2%) died. Maternal and infant mortality rates were 587
                    of 100,000 and 33 of 1000, while country rates are 1000 of 100,000 and 101 of

                <title>Epidemiology of breast cancer subtypes in two prospective cohort studies of
                    breast cancer survivors.</title>
                <description>ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe breast
                    tumor subtypes by common breast cancer risk factors and to determine correlates
                    of subtypes using baseline data from two pooled prospective breast cancer
                    studies within a large health maintenance organization. METHODS: Tumor data on
                    2,544 invasive breast cancer cases subtyped by estrogen receptor, progesterone
                    receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu) status were
                    obtained (1,868 luminal A tumors, 294 luminal B tumors, 288 triple negative
                    tumors and 94 Her2/neu-overexpressing tumors). Demographic, reproductive and
                    lifestyle information was collected either through in-person or mailed
                    questionnaires. Case-only odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
                    were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for age at diagnosis,
                    race/ethnicity and study origin. RESULTS: Compared to luminal A cases, luminal B
                    cases were more likely to be younger at diagnosis (P trend = 0.0001) and were
                    less likely to consume alcohol (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.56-0.98), use hormone
                    replacement therapy (HRT) (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.46-0.94), and oral
                    contraceptives (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.96). Compared to luminal A cases,
                    triple negative cases tended to be younger at diagnosis (P trend less than or
                    equal to 0.0001) and African American (OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 2.12-4.16), were more
                    likely to have not breastfed if they had parity greater than or equal to 3 (OR =
                    1.68, 95% CI: 1.00-2.81), and were more likely to be overweight (OR = 1.82, 95%
                    CI: 1.03-3.24) or obese (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.03-3.77) if premenopausal.
                    Her2-overexpressing cases were more likely to be younger at diagnosis (P trend =
                    0.03) and Hispanic (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.16-4.13) or Asian (OR = 2.02, 95% CI:
                    1.05-3.88), and less likely to use HRT (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.26-0.79).
                    CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that investigators should consider tumor
                    heterogeneity in associations with traditional breast cancer risk factors.
                    Important modifiable lifestyle factors that may be related to the development of
                    a specific tumor subtype, but not all subtypes, include obesity, breastfeeding
                    and alcohol consumption. Future work that will further categorize triple
                    negative cases into basal and non-basal tumors may help to elucidate these
                    associations further.</description>

                <title>Randomized controlled trial of a paraprofessional-delivered in-home
                    intervention for young reservation-based American Indian mothers.</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a paraprofessional-delivered,
                    home-visiting intervention among young, reservation-based American Indian (AI)
                    mothers on parenting knowledge, involvement, and maternal and infant outcomes.
                    METHOD: From 2002 to 2004, expectant AI women aged 12 to 22 years (n = 167) were
                    randomized (1:1) to one of two paraprofessional-delivered, home-visiting
                    interventions: the 25-visit "Family Spirit" intervention addressing prenatal and
                    newborn care and maternal life skills (treatment) or a 23-visit
                    breast-feeding/nutrition education intervention (active control). The
                    interventions began during pregnancy and continued to 6 months postpartum.
                    Mothers and children were evaluated at baseline and 2, 6, and 12 months
                    postpartum. Primary outcomes included changes in mothers' parenting knowledge
                    and involvement. Secondary outcomes included infants' social and emotional
                    behavior; the home environment; and mothers' stress, social support, depression,
                    and substance use. RESULTS: Participants were mostly teenaged, first-time,
                    unmarried mothers living in reservation communities. At 6 and 12 months
                    postpartum, treatment mothers compared with control mothers had greater
                    parenting knowledge gains, 13.5 (p &lt; .0001) and 13.9 (p &lt; .0001)
                    points higher, respectively (100-point scale). At 12 months postpartum,
                    treatment mothers reported their infants to have significantly lower scores on
                    the externalizing domain (beta = -.17, p &lt; .05) and less separation
                    distress in the internalizing domain (beta = -.17, p &lt; .05). No
                    between-group differences were found for maternal involvement, home environment,
                    or mothers' stress, social support, depression, or substance use. CONCLUSIONS:
                    This study supports the efficacy of the paraprofessional-delivered Family Spirit
                    home-visiting intervention for young AI mothers on maternal knowledge and infant
                    behavior outcomes. A longer, larger study is needed to replicate results and
                    evaluate the durability of child behavior outcomes.</description>

                <title>Infant feeding in the first 12 weeks following birth: A comparison of
                    patterns seen in Asian and non-Asian women in Australia.</title>
                <description>BACKGROUND: There is a belief amongst midwives that Asian women are
                    less likely to breastfeed compared to non-Asian women. The aim of this research
                    was to compare the infant feeding decisions of Asian and non-Asian women on
                    discharge from two Sydney hospitals, and at 6 and 12 weeks following birth.
                    PARTICIPANTS: 235 Asian and 462 non-Asian first time mothers. METHODS: A
                    secondary analysis was undertaken into data from a randomised clinical trial of
                    a perineal management technique (perineal warm packs). Simple descriptive
                    statistics were used for analysis and Chi-square and logistic regression was
                    used to examine differences between women from Asian and non-Asian backgrounds.
                    RESULTS: Compared with non-Asian women, Asian women were no less likely to
                    exclusively breastfeed on discharge from hospital (83% vs. 87%, OR 0.7, 95% CI
                    0.4-1.2), at 6 weeks (60% vs. 61%, OR 1, 95% CI 0.7-1.4) or 12 weeks postpartum
                    (51% vs. 56%, OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-1.2). They were, however, significantly more
                    likely to be partially breastfeeding on discharge from hospital (10% vs. 2%, OR
                    5.3, 95% CI 2.3-12.4), at 6 weeks (22% vs. 11%, OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.2) and 12
                    weeks postpartum (17% vs. 8%, OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.9). DISCUSSION: Asian women
                    were more likely than non-Asian women to be giving their baby some breast milk
                    at 6 and 12 weeks postpartum when partial breastfeeding was taken into account.
                    This contradicts popular beliefs amongst midwives regarding the infant feeding
                    practices of Asian women. CONCLUSION: Further research into this important issue
                    is needed in order to improve breastfeeding support for women from different
                    cultural backgrounds. The issue of causes of, and variations in, the levels of
                    partial breastfeeding between different ethnic groups needs more
                    investigation.</description>

                <title>Enteral Nutrition Support of the Preterm Infant in the Neonatal Intensive
                    Care Unit.</title>
                <description>The delivery of a preterm baby is a nutrition emergency. Growth and the
                    accumulation of nutrient reserves are higher during the third trimester of
                    pregnancy than at any other time during the life cycle. Enteral nutrition is the
                    preferred mode of support and human milk the preferred source of enteral
                    nutrition. Human milk is highly digestible and contains many anti-infective
                    components, which confer a lower risk of infection. The mother of a preterm
                    infant requires education, equipment, and encouragement to successfully initiate
                    and sustain lactation. Human milk requires nutrient fortification to meet the
                    protein and mineral needs of the rapidly growing preterm infant. Commercial
                    human milk fortifiers are available. If human milk is unavailable or the volume
                    is insufficient, preterm formulas are available. Preterm formulas have different
                    sources of macronutrients and greater density of all nutrients than formulas
                    intended for term newborns. Preterm infants benefit from early enteral feedings
                    with slow but steady increases in feedings to achieve full support. Infants born
                    at &lt;35 weeks gestational age are supported with tube feedings. A
                    transition to feedings at the breast or to bottle feedings is gradually made as
                    the baby matures. Nutrient recommendations specific to the preterm infant are
                    available. Special products and feeding strategies exist to respond to common
                    medical conditions that can complicate nutrition management. Optimal nutrition
                    care of the preterm infant offers the opportunity to improve outcomes for
                    children.</description>

                <title>Recent advances in knowledge of zinc nutrition and human health.</title>
                <description>Zinc deficiency increases the risk and severity of a variety of
                    infections, restricts physical growth, and affects specific outcomes of
                    pregnancy. Global recognition of the importance of zinc nutrition in public
                    health has expanded dramatically in recent years, and more experience has
                    accumulated on the design and implementation of zinc intervention programs.
                    Therefore, the Steering Committee of the International Zinc Nutrition
                    Consultative Group (IZiNCG) completed a second IZiNCG technical document that
                    reexamines the latest information on the intervention strategies that have been
                    developed to enhance zinc nutrition and control zinc deficiency. In particular,
                    the document reviews the current evidence regarding preventive zinc
                    supplementation and the role of zinc as adjunctive therapy for selected
                    infections, zinc fortification, and dietary diversification or modification
                    strategies, including the promotion and protection of breastfeeding and
                    biofortification. The purposes of this introductory paper are to summarize new
                    guidelines on the assessment of population zinc status, as recommended by the
                    World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF),
                    the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and IZiNCG, and to provide an
                    overview on several new advances in zinc metabolism. The following papers will
                    then review the intervention strategies individually.</description>

                <title>Systematic Review: The Role of Breastfeeding in the Development of Pediatric
                    Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVES: To assess the current evidence for the role of
                    breastfeeding in the development of early onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
                    with a systematic review. STUDY DESIGN: An electronic database search was
                    performed (January 1966-January 2008) with keywords related to IBD and
                    breastfeeding, looking specifically for studies that reported outcome in
                    early-onset disease (&lt;16 years of age) and "any exposure" to breast milk
                    as the variables. Meta-analysis of studies included for review was then
                    performed by using a random effects model, and results were expressed as odds
                    ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 79 articles were identified, 20 of
                    which were found describing breastfeeding in relation to the development of IBD;
                    8 of these articles included separate early-onset groups. One study did not
                    describe "any exposure" to breast milk for the early onset group, so 7 studies
                    were included in the meta-analysis. Breast milk exposure had a significant
                    protective effect (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.94; P = .02) in developing
                    early-onset IBD. A non-significant difference was demonstrated for ulcerative
                    colitis and Crohn's disease individually (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.51-1.02; P = .06;
                    OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.38-1.07; P = .09, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The current
                    evidence demonstrates a possible protective effect for breast milk in the
                    development of early onset IBD. However, the quality of existing data is
                    generally poor. These findings need to be investigated in well-designed
                    prospective studies.</description>

                <title>Newborn Individual Development Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP): A
                    Systematic Review of the Literature.</title>
                <description>Background: Important advancements have been made in the care of
                    preterm infants. Health services have introduced various methods aimed at
                    promoting attachment, breastfeeding, and neurological development. The Newborn
                    Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP), developed to
                    stimulate preterm infants at levels adapted to the child's degree of
                    neurological maturity, is increasingly being used. Objectives: The aim was to
                    investigate the impact of NIDCAP on the psychomotor development, neurological
                    status, medical/nursing care outcomes, and parental perceptions. A further aim
                    was to evaluate the cost-related effects of NIDCAP. Data Extraction and
                    Analysis: A literature search up to September 2007 was performed. The reviewed
                    papers were assessed for methodological quality and only statistically
                    significant findings were extracted. Findings: The evidence compiled on the
                    effects of NIDCAP is based on 12 articles from six randomized controlled trials
                    that included approximately 250 children. Each of the studies was assessed as
                    having medium quality. Most of the studies were small and many investigated a
                    huge number of outcome variables, which decreased their scientific strength. On
                    outcome variables in which a significant difference was found between the
                    intervention (NIDCAP) and control groups, most studies showed better results for
                    the NIDCAP group. This was particularly valid for cognitive and psychomotor
                    development. Four studies also showed a reduced need for respiratory support for
                    the NIDCAP group. No studies were identified that weighed the total cost of
                    NIDCAP against its effects. Conclusions: Despite promising findings, primarily
                    on cognitive and motor development, the scientific evidence on the effects of
                    NIDCAP is limited. Shortcomings in design and methods in the reviewed studies
                    hamper far-reaching claims on the effectiveness of the method. Scientific
                    grounds for assessing the effects of NIDCAP would be substantially enhanced by a
                    sufficiently comprehensive study with extended follow-up and a clear focus on a
                    few important outcome variables.</description>

                <title>A Meta-Analysis of Association between Maternal Smoking during Pregnancy and
                    Offspring Obesity.</title>
                <description>Abstract Background: Recent reports have suggested that maternal
                    smoking may increase the risks of the unborn child developing obesity in later
                    life. However, relatively few cohort studies have investigated the relationship
                    between maternal smoking during pregnancy and future development of the
                    metabolic syndrome. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis
                    of observational studies reporting effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals
                    (95% CI) on the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and
                    obesity of future offspring. Results: Seventeen papers were identified from 444
                    English-language papers (key word search: maternal smoking and obesity) in
                    PubMed. All papers showed a positive association between maternal smoking during
                    pregnancy and childhood obesity. The meta-analysis, using the DerSimonian-Laird
                    method, revealed the association to be statistically significant. In association
                    with maternal smoking during pregnancy and body mass index with more than 95 %
                    CI at the age of 3 to 33 years offspring, the pooled odds ratio calculated from
                    16 of these 17 studies was 1.64 (95% CI: 1.42-1.90). After adjustment for
                    publication bias, the pooled adjusted odds ratio was 1.52 (95% CI: 1.36-1.70) In
                    addition, confounders of maternal obesity, low social status, low birth weight
                    and not-breast-feeding seemed to be risk factors for offspring obesity.
                    Conclusion: These data indicate that maternal smoking during pregnancy may cause
                    future obesity and metabolic syndrome.</description>

                <title>Breastfeeding and breast cancer risk in India: A multicenter case-control
                    study.</title>
                <description>Breast cancer incidence is low in India compared with high-income
                    countries, but it has increased in recent decades, particularly among urban
                    women. The reasons for this pattern are not known although they are likely
                    related to reproductive and lifestyle factors. Here, we report the results of a
                    large case-control study on the association between breastfeeding and breast
                    cancer risk. The study was conducted in 2 areas in South India during 2002-2005
                    and included 1,866 cases and 1,873 controls. Detailed information regarding
                    menstruation, reproduction, breastfeeding and physical activity was collected
                    through in-person interview. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
                    were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models. Breastfeeding for
                    long duration was common in the study population. Lifetime duration of
                    breastfeeding was inversely associated with breast cancer risk among
                    premenopausal women (p-value of linear trend, 0.02). No such protective effect
                    was observed in postmenopausal women, among whom a protective effect of parity
                    was suggested. A reduction of breast cancer risk with prolonged breastfeeding
                    was shown among premenopausal women. Health campaign focusing on breastfeeding
                    behavior by appropriately educating women would contribute to reduce breast
                    cancer burden. (c) 2009 UICC.</description>

                <title>Respiratory Infection, Exposure to Mouse Allergen and Breastfeeding: Role in
                    Recurrent Wheezing in Early Life.</title>
                <description>Background: Environmental factors may influence the development of
                    allergen sensitization and asthma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
                    role of endotoxin and allergen exposure in early life as a risk factor for
                    recurrent wheezing. Methods: One hundred and four infants from low-income
                    families, at high risk of asthma, were enrolled at birth. Dust samples were
                    collected from the bedding and bedroom floor within 6 months after birth.
                    Recurrent wheezing was defined as 3 or more wheezing episodes in the past year.
                    Endotoxin was determined by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay, and major indoor
                    allergens were quantitated by ELISA in dust extracts. IgE antibodies were
                    measured by ImmunoCAP at 30 months of age. Results: At 30 months, 51 of the 99
                    infants who completed the study (51.5%) had recurrent wheezing. Respiratory
                    infection was strongly associated with recurrent wheezing (OR 6.67, 95% CI
                    1.96-22.72), whereas exclusive breastfeeding for at least 1 month was a
                    protective factor (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.51). Exposure to high levels of mouse
                    allergen was more frequent among non-recurrent wheezers, approaching
                    significance (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01-1.13; p = 0.064). None of the children were
                    sensitized to mouse. Sensitization to mite was found in 26/90 (28.8%) children,
                    with no association with recurrent wheezing. Conclusion: Respiratory infection
                    was strongly associated with recurrent wheezing in the first 30 months of life,
                    in children at high risk of asthma, living in a socially deprived community in
                    Brazil.</description>

                <title>Which mothers wean their babies prematurely from full breastfeeding? An
                    Australian cohort study.</title>
                <description>Aim: To identify the maternal and infant characteristics associated
                    with an early transition from full breastfeeding to complementary or no
                    breastfeeding during the first 2 months of life in a large, representative
                    cohort of Australian infants. Method: Multinomial logistic modelling was
                    performed on data for infants with complete breastfeeding and sociodemographic
                    data (N = 4679) including maternal age, education, smoking, employment,
                    pregnancy and birth outcomes. Results: Ninety-one percent of women initiated
                    breastfeeding. Sixty-nine percent of infants were being fully breastfed at 1
                    month, and 59% were fully breastfed at 2 months. Maternal characteristics - age
                    less than 25 years, smoking in pregnancy, early full-time postnatal employment
                    and less educational attainment - were associated with early breastfeeding
                    cessation. Infant factors - multiple birth, caesarean birth, infant or first
                    birth - were associated with a transition to complementary breastfeeding in the
                    first postnatal month. Conclusion: Breastfeeding duration is substantially
                    affected by breastfeeding outcomes in the first postpartum month. The first
                    month is an important window for evidence-based interventions to improve rates
                    of full breastfeeding in groups of women identified as at risk of early
                    breastfeeding cessation.</description>

                <title>Epidemiology of breast cancer subtypes in two prospective cohort studies of
                    breast cancer survivors.</title>
                <description>ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe breast
                    tumor subtypes by common breast cancer risk factors and to determine correlates
                    of subtypes using baseline data from two pooled prospective breast cancer
                    studies within a large health maintenance organization. METHODS: Tumor data on
                    2,544 invasive breast cancer cases subtyped by estrogen receptor, progesterone
                    receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu) status were
                    obtained (1,868 luminal A tumors, 294 luminal B tumors, 288 triple negative
                    tumors and 94 Her2/neu-overexpressing tumors). Demographic, reproductive and
                    lifestyle information was collected either through in-person or mailed
                    questionnaires. Case-only odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
                    were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for age at diagnosis,
                    race/ethnicity and study origin. RESULTS: Compared to luminal A cases, luminal B
                    cases were more likely to be younger at diagnosis (P trend = 0.0001) and were
                    less likely to consume alcohol (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.56-0.98), use hormone
                    replacement therapy (HRT) (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.46-0.94), and oral
                    contraceptives (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.96). Compared to luminal A cases,
                    triple negative cases tended to be younger at diagnosis (P trend less than or
                    equal to 0.0001) and African American (OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 2.12-4.16), were more
                    likely to have not breastfed if they had parity greater than or equal to 3 (OR =
                    1.68, 95% CI: 1.00-2.81), and were more likely to be overweight (OR = 1.82, 95%
                    CI: 1.03-3.24) or obese (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.03-3.77) if premenopausal.
                    Her2-overexpressing cases were more likely to be younger at diagnosis (P trend =
                    0.03) and Hispanic (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.16-4.13) or Asian (OR = 2.02, 95% CI:
                    1.05-3.88), and less likely to use HRT (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.26-0.79).
                    CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that investigators should consider tumor
                    heterogeneity in associations with traditional breast cancer risk factors.
                    Important modifiable lifestyle factors that may be related to the development of
                    a specific tumor subtype, but not all subtypes, include obesity, breastfeeding
                    and alcohol consumption. Future work that will further categorize triple
                    negative cases into basal and non-basal tumors may help to elucidate these
                    associations further.</description>

                <title>Breastfeeding and breast cancer risk in India: A multicenter case-control
                    study.</title>
                <description>Breast cancer incidence is low in India compared with high-income
                    countries, but it has increased in recent decades, particularly among urban
                    women. The reasons for this pattern are not known although they are likely
                    related to reproductive and lifestyle factors. Here, we report the results of a
                    large case-control study on the association between breastfeeding and breast
                    cancer risk. The study was conducted in 2 areas in South India during 2002-2005
                    and included 1,866 cases and 1,873 controls. Detailed information regarding
                    menstruation, reproduction, breastfeeding and physical activity was collected
                    through in-person interview. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
                    were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models. Breastfeeding for
                    long duration was common in the study population. Lifetime duration of
                    breastfeeding was inversely associated with breast cancer risk among
                    premenopausal women (p-value of linear trend, 0.02). No such protective effect
                    was observed in postmenopausal women, among whom a protective effect of parity
                    was suggested. A reduction of breast cancer risk with prolonged breastfeeding
                    was shown among premenopausal women. Health campaign focusing on breastfeeding
                    behavior by appropriately educating women would contribute to reduce breast
                    cancer burden. (c) 2009 UICC.</description>

                <title>Breastfeeding duration and exclusivity associated with infants' health and
                    growth: data from a prospective cohort study in Bavaria, Germany.</title>
                <description>AIM: To investigate the relationship between breastfeeding and infant
                    health and to describe growth in the first 9 months. METHODS: Mothers delivering
                    a baby in April 2005 were recruited throughout Bavaria, Germany, for a
                    prospective birth cohort study. These mothers reported breastfeeding data,
                    health and growth data of 1901 infants assessed by a physician in questionnaires
                    on day 2-6, and in months 2, 4, 6 and 9. Subjects were healthy term infants with
                    a birth weight &gt; or =2500 g. We compared 475 infants breastfed
                    exclusively for &gt; or =6 months (group A), 870 infants breastfed
                    fully/exclusively &gt; or =4 months, but not exclusively &gt; or =6
                    months (group B) and 619 infants not breastfed/breastfed &lt;4 months (group
                    C). RESULTS: In multivariate analysis &gt; or =6 months of exclusive
                    breastfeeding reduced significantly the risk for &gt; or =1 episode of
                    gastrointestinal infection(s) during months 1-9 compared to no/&lt;4 months
                    breastfeeding (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
                    0.44-0.82). The application of the World Health Organization (WHO)-child growth
                    standards showed lower weight-for-length z-scores in first days of life in group
                    C versus groups A and B, whereas in months 6/7 group C showed the highest
                    scores. CONCLUSION: Differences in child growth depending on breastfeeding
                    duration should be investigated further. Concerning health outcomes our findings
                    support the recommendation for &gt; or =6 months of exclusive
                    breastfeeding.</description>

                <title>Are Starting and Continuing Breastfeeding Related to Educational Background?
                    The Generation R Study.</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVE. To assess the effect of a woman's educational level on
                    starting and continuing breastfeeding and to assess the role of
                    sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, psychosocial, and birth characteristics in
                    this association. METHODS. We used the data of 2914 participants in a
                    population-based prospective cohort study. Information on educational level,
                    breastfeeding, sociodemographic (maternal age, single parenthood, parity, job
                    status), lifestyle-related (BMI, smoking, alcohol use), psychosocial (whether
                    the pregnancy was planned, stress), and birth (gestational age, birth weight,
                    cesarean delivery, place and type of delivery) characteristics were obtained
                    between pregnancy and 12 months postpartum. Odds ratios and 95% confidence
                    intervals of starting and continuing breastfeeding for educational level were
                    obtained by logistic regression, adjusted for each group of covariates and for
                    all covariates simultaneously. RESULTS. Of 1031 highest-educated mothers, 985
                    (95.5%) started breastfeeding; the percentage was 73.1% (255 of 349) in the
                    lowest-educated mothers. At 6 months, 39.3% (405 of 1031) of highest-educated
                    mothers and 15.2% (53 of 349) of lowest-educated mothers were still
                    breastfeeding. Educationally related differences were present in starting
                    breastfeeding and the continuation of breastfeeding until 2 months but not in
                    breastfeeding continuation between 2 and 6 months. Lifestyle-related and birth
                    characteristics attenuated the association between educational level and
                    breastfeeding, but the association was hardly affected by sociodemographic and
                    psychosocial characteristics. CONCLUSIONS. Decisions to breastfeed were
                    underlain by differences in educational background. The underlying pathways
                    require further research. For the time being, interventions on promoting
                    breastfeeding should start early in pregnancy and should increase their focus on
                    low-educated women.</description>

                <title>Sex differences in the association between infant feeding and blood
                    cholesterol in later life: the Newcastle thousand families cohort study at age
                    49-51 years.</title>
                <description>Previous studies have suggested an association between being breastfed
                    and later cholesterol levels. We investigated whether duration of total and
                    exclusive breastfeeding were related to circulating total, HDL and LDL
                    cholesterol and triglyceride measures at age 50, and whether such associations
                    differ between men and women. Members of the Newcastle thousand families study
                    were followed from birth in 1947. Men (n = 179) and 226 women (n = 226) with
                    blood cholesterol and triglyceride measures at age 50 and with prospectively
                    recorded duration of both total and exclusive breastfeeding were included.
                    Neither total duration nor duration of exclusive breastfeeding were associated
                    with the outcome measures when analysing both sexes together. However, in sex
                    specific analyses significant associations between duration of exclusive
                    breastfeeding and both total and LDL cholesterol (adjusted regression
                    coefficient (r) per 30 days = 0.12 mmol/l (95% CI 0.04-0.20) P = 0.004 for total
                    cholesterol and adjusted r per 30 days = 0.10 mmol/l (95% CI 0.02-0.18) P =
                    0.016 for LDL cholesterol) were seen for women with no significant associations
                    observed in men. Significant interactions between duration of exclusive
                    breastfeeding and sex were seen for total and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.02 and P =
                    0.03, respectively) with a near-significant interaction for HDL cholesterol (P =
                    0.06). In all cases, greater increases in cholesterol with increasing duration
                    of exclusive breastfeeding were seen for women than for men. In conclusion, the
                    association between breastfeeding and adult cholesterol levels differs between
                    men and women and in women remains a significant association even after
                    adjustment for potential confounders. However, our findings may not reflect the
                    situation in younger generations.</description>

                <title>Systematic Review: The Role of Breastfeeding in the Development of Pediatric
                    Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</title>
                <description>OBJECTIVES: To assess the current evidence for the role of
                    breastfeeding in the development of early onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
                    with a systematic review. STUDY DESIGN: An electronic database search was
                    performed (January 1966-January 2008) with keywords related to IBD and
                    breastfeeding, looking specifically for studies that reported outcome in
                    early-onset disease (&lt;16 years of age) and "any exposure" to breast milk
                    as the variables. Meta-analysis of studies included for review was then
                    performed by using a random effects model, and results were expressed as odds
                    ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 79 articles were identified, 20 of
                    which were found describing breastfeeding in relation to the development of IBD;
                    8 of these articles included separate early-onset groups. One study did not
                    describe "any exposure" to breast milk for the early onset group, so 7 studies
                    were included in the meta-analysis. Breast milk exposure had a significant
                    protective effect (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.94; P = .02) in developing
                    early-onset IBD. A non-significant difference was demonstrated for ulcerative
                    colitis and Crohn's disease individually (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.51-1.02; P = .06;
                    OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.38-1.07; P = .09, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The current
                    evidence demonstrates a possible protective effect for breast milk in the
                    development of early onset IBD. However, the quality of existing data is
                    generally poor. These findings need to be investigated in well-designed
                    prospective studies.</description>

                <title>Breastfeeding and breast cancer risk in India: A multicenter case-control
                    study.</title>
                <description>Breast cancer incidence is low in India compared with high-income
                    countries, but it has increased in recent decades, particularly among urban
                    women. The reasons for this pattern are not known although they are likely
                    related to reproductive and lifestyle factors. Here, we report the results of a
                    large case-control study on the association between breastfeeding and breast
                    cancer risk. The study was conducted in 2 areas in South India during 2002-2005
                    and included 1,866 cases and 1,873 controls. Detailed information regarding
                    menstruation, reproduction, breastfeeding and physical activity was collected
                    through in-person interview. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
                    were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models. Breastfeeding for
                    long duration was common in the study population. Lifetime duration of
                    breastfeeding was inversely associated with breast cancer risk among
                    premenopausal women (p-value of linear trend, 0.02). No such protective effect
                    was observed in postmenopausal women, among whom a protective effect of parity
                    was suggested. A reduction of breast cancer risk with prolonged breastfeeding
                    was shown among premenopausal women. Health campaign focusing on breastfeeding
                    behavior by appropriately educating women would contribute to reduce breast
                    cancer burden. (c) 2009 UICC.</description>

                <title>Respiratory Infection, Exposure to Mouse Allergen and Breastfeeding: Role in
                    Recurrent Wheezing in Early Life.</title>
                <description>Background: Environmental factors may influence the development of
                    allergen sensitization and asthma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
                    role of endotoxin and allergen exposure in early life as a risk factor for
                    recurrent wheezing. Methods: One hundred and four infants from low-income
                    families, at high risk of asthma, were enrolled at birth. Dust samples were
                    collected from the bedding and bedroom floor within 6 months after birth.
                    Recurrent wheezing was defined as 3 or more wheezing episodes in the past year.
                    Endotoxin was determined by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay, and major indoor
                    allergens were quantitated by ELISA in dust extracts. IgE antibodies were
                    measured by ImmunoCAP at 30 months of age. Results: At 30 months, 51 of the 99
                    infants who completed the study (51.5%) had recurrent wheezing. Respiratory
                    infection was strongly associated with recurrent wheezing (OR 6.67, 95% CI
                    1.96-22.72), whereas exclusive breastfeeding for at least 1 month was a
                    protective factor (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.51). Exposure to high levels of mouse
                    allergen was more frequent among non-recurrent wheezers, approaching
                    significance (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01-1.13; p = 0.064). None of the children were
                    sensitized to mouse. Sensitization to mite was found in 26/90 (28.8%) children,
                    with no association with recurrent wheezing. Conclusion: Respiratory infection
                    was strongly associated with recurrent wheezing in the first 30 months of life,
                    in children at high risk of asthma, living in a socially deprived community in
                    Brazil.</description>

                <title>Weight gain in childhood and blood lipids in adolescence.</title>
                <description>AIM: To assess the effect of weight gain in childhood on blood lipid
                    levels in adolescence. METHODS: A population-based birth cohort carried out in
                    Pelotas, Southern Brazil. All newborns in the city's hospitals were enrolled in
                    1982. The subjects have been followed up for several times in childhood. At age
                    18, 79% of all males were followed, and 2083 blood samples were available.
                    Adjusted analyses controlled for household assets index, family income, parental
                    schooling at birth, maternal smoking during pregnancy and breastfeeding
                    duration. RESULTS: Birth weight for gestational age and weight gain in the first
                    20 months was not associated with blood lipid levels in adolescence. On the
                    other hand, those subjects whose weight gain from 20 to 42 months of age was
                    faster than that predicted from birth weight and weight-for-age z-score at the
                    mean age of 20 months had lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL)
                    cholesterol [-0.78(95% confidence interval: -1.28; -0.29)] and higher very
                    low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein
                    cholesterol (LDL)/HDL ratio in adolescence. After controlling for current body
                    mass index (BMI), the regression coefficient for HDL cholesterol decreased from
                    -0.78 mg/dL to -0.29 mg/dL (95% confidence interval: -1.00 to 0.05). CONCLUSION:
                    Weight gain from 2 to 4 years is related to an atherogenic lipid profile in
                    adolescence and this association is mediated by current BMI.</description>

                <title>Breastfeeding duration and exclusivity associated with infants' health and
                    growth: data from a prospective cohort study in Bavaria, Germany.</title>
                <description>AIM: To investigate the relationship between breastfeeding and infant
                    health and to describe growth in the first 9 months. METHODS: Mothers delivering
                    a baby in April 2005 were recruited throughout Bavaria, Germany, for a
                    prospective birth cohort study. These mothers reported breastfeeding data,
                    health and growth data of 1901 infants assessed by a physician in questionnaires
                    on day 2-6, and in months 2, 4, 6 and 9. Subjects were healthy term infants with
                    a birth weight &gt; or =2500 g. We compared 475 infants breastfed
                    exclusively for &gt; or =6 months (group A), 870 infants breastfed
                    fully/exclusively &gt; or =4 months, but not exclusively &gt; or =6
                    months (group B) and 619 infants not breastfed/breastfed &lt;4 months (group
                    C). RESULTS: In multivariate analysis &gt; or =6 months of exclusive
                    breastfeeding reduced significantly the risk for &gt; or =1 episode of
                    gastrointestinal infection(s) during months 1-9 compared to no/&lt;4 months
                    breastfeeding (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
                    0.44-0.82). The application of the World Health Organization (WHO)-child growth
                    standards showed lower weight-for-length z-scores in first days of life in group
                    C versus groups A and B, whereas in months 6/7 group C showed the highest
                    scores. CONCLUSION: Differences in child growth depending on breastfeeding
                    duration should be investigated further. Concerning health outcomes our findings
                    support the recommendation for &gt; or =6 months of exclusive
                    breastfeeding.</description>

                    Year of Age in Sub-Saharan Africa With Maternal Use of Highly Active
                    Antiretroviral Therapy During Breast-Feeding.</title>
                <description>BACKGROUND:: Reduction of HIV-1 breast-feeding transmission remains a
                    challenge for prevention of pediatric infections in Sub-Saharan Africa.
                    Provision of formula decreases transmission but often increases child mortality
                    in this setting. METHODS:: A prospective observational cohort study of HIV-1
                    exposed infants of mothers receiving pre and postnatal medical care at Drug
                    Resource Enhancement Against AIDS and Malnutrition centers in Mozambique was
                    conducted. Live-born infants of HIV-1-infected women receiving medical care were
                    enrolled. HIV-1 testing was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months of age using
                    branched DNA. Mothers were counseled to breast-feed exclusively for 6 months and
                    were provided HAART antenatally and postnatally for the first 6 months. Women
                    with CD4 cell counts less than 350/cmm at baseline continued HAART indefinitely.
                    RESULTS:: Of 341 infants followed from birth, 313 mother-infant pairs (92%)
                    completed 6 months and 283 (83%) completed 12 months of follow-up. HIV-1
                    diagnosis was ascertained in 287 infants (84%) including 4 who died. There were
                    8 cases of HIV-1 transmission: 4 of 341 (1.2%) at 1 month, 2 of 313 (0.6%) at 6
                    months, and 2 of 276 (0.7%) at 12 months (cumulative rate: 2.8%). Two mothers
                    (0.6%) and 11 infants (3.2%) died. Maternal and infant mortality rates were 587
                    of 100,000 and 33 of 1000, while country rates are 1000 of 100,000 and 101 of
                    1000. HIV risk reduction was 93% and HIV-free survival at 12 months was 94%.
                    CONCLUSIONS:: Late postnatal transmission of HIV-1 is significantly decreased by
                    maternal use of HAART with high infant survival rates up to 12 months of
                    age.</description>

                    reproductive aged women. Adjuvant systemic therapy is recommended in most women
                    and has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of recurrence and increase
                    survival. However, there may be a negative impact of adjuvant systemic therapy
                    on fertility as well as on subsequent quality of life. There are a number of
                    fertility preservation options currently available and relevant information
                    regarding these options should be provided prior to commencing adjuvant
                    treatment. The aim of the review is to identify the fertility-related needs,
                    concerns and preferences of young women with early breast cancer. The databases
                    MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1988 onwards using keywords, and examining
                    reference lists. Of the 499 articles identified, 20 met eligibility criteria and
                    were reviewed. Multiple fertility-related information needs specific to this
                    group regarding menstrual changes and potential infertility attitudes to, and
                    actual decisions made regarding, pregnancy breastfeeding and contraception
                    emerged. Information on fertility-related decisions was rated as important, and
                    the preferred methods for obtaining this information was consultation with a
                    specialist or a decision aid early in the treatment plan. There is limited
                    research about fertility-related needs, and even less on contraceptive
                    preferences and the attitudes of health care providers towards fertility-related
                    issues. No studies describing the development of tools to assist with decisions
                    about fertility-related choices were identified. Young women with early breast
                    cancer have specific fertility- and menopause-related needs and concerns, which
                    are commonly not adequately addressed or discussed prior to commencing adjuvant
                    therapy.</description>

                <title>The relationship between infant-feeding outcomes and postpartum depression: a
                    qualitative systematic review.</title>
                <description>CONTEXT: The negative health consequences of postpartum depression are
                    well documented, as are the benefits of breastfeeding. Despite the detailed
                    research related to these maternal and infant health outcomes, the relationship
                    between maternal mood and breastfeeding remains equivocal. OBJECTIVE: A
                    qualitative systematic review was conducted to examine the relationship between
                    postpartum depressive symptomatology and infant-feeding outcomes. METHODS: We
                    performed electronic searchers in Medline (1966-2007), the Cumulative Index to
                    Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982-2007), and Embase
                    (1980-2007) by using specific key words. A hand search of selected specialist
                    journals and reference lists of articles obtained was then conducted.
                    Seventy-five articles were reviewed, of which 49 specifically provided data to
                    be extracted related to postpartum depressive symptomatology and infant-feeding
                    outcomes. Both authors independently extracted data including study design,
                    participants (number and characteristics), and results. RESULTS: The results
                    from this review suggest that women with depressive symptomatology in the early
                    postpartum period may be at increased risk for negative infant-feeding outcomes
                    including decreased breastfeeding duration, increased breastfeeding
                    difficulties, and decreased levels of breastfeeding self-efficacy. There is also
                    beginning evidence to suggest that depressed women may be less likely to
                    initiate breastfeeding and do so exclusively. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive
                    symptomatology in the postpartum period negatively influences infant-feeding
                    outcomes. These findings have important clinical implications and support the
                    need for early identification and treatment of women with depressive
                    symptomatology. However, strategies to address help-seeking barriers are needed
                    if women are to receive appropriate and timely treatment. Research to determine
                    effective interventions to support depressed breastfeeding women is
                    warranted.</description>

                <title>Clinical protocol number #19: breastfeeding promotion in the prenatal
                    setting.</title>
                <description>A central goal of The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine is the
                    development of clinical protocols for managing common medical problems that may
                    impact breastfeeding success. These protocols serve only as guidelines for the
                    care of breastfeeding mothers and infants and do not delineate an exclusive
                    course of treatment or serve as standards of medical care. Variations in
                    treatment may be appropriate according to the needs of an individual
                    patient.</description>
