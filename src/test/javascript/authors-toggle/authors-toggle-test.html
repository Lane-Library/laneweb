                <div class="description">Research in autophagy continues to accelerate,(1) and as a result many new scientists are entering the field. Accordingly, it
                    is important to establish a standard set of criteria for monitoring macroautophagy in different organisms. Recent reviews have described the range of
                    assays that have been used for this purpose.(2,3) There are many useful and convenient methods that can be used to monitor macroautophagy in yeast, but
                    relatively few in other model systems, and there is much confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure macroautophagy in higher eukaryotes. A key
                    point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers of autophagosomes versus those that
                    measure flux through the autophagy pathway; thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from
                    fully functional autophagy that includes delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes) or the vacuole (in plants and
                    fungi). Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of the methods that can be used by investigators who are attempting to
                    examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as by reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that investigate
                    these processes. This set of guidelines is not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being
                    asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and
                    we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to verify an autophagic response.</div>
