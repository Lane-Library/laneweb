Nearly half (47%, 482/1021) reported that all of their children were vaccinated against hepatitis B but that they did not always recommend that vaccine to patients; the same discordance was observed among 36% (369/1027) for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, 19% (194/1013) to 28% (290/1019) for routine and catch-up meningococcal C vaccination, and 27% (136/496) for the human papillomavirus vaccine. Cluster analysis showed that 37% (95% CI 33-39%) of GPs reported above-average rate of systematic vaccine recommendations for their patients, and most reported that all their children were vaccinated (low level of discordance), while 60% (95%CI 58-64%) had a high level of discordance, that is, most reported that their children were vaccinated, but did not always recommend the same vaccines to their patients.::CONCLUSIONS##Many GPs do not report the same attitude concerning the vaccination of their children and their patients.

The aim of this study is to analyze whether TRIM5 and TRIM22 polymorphisms are associated with liver fibrosis inflammation-related biomarkers and response to pegylated-interferon-alpha plus ribavirin (pegIFNα/RBV) therapy in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfected patients.::METHODS##A retrospective study was performed in 319 patients who started pegIFNα/RBV therapy. Liver fibrosis stage was characterized in 288 patients. TRIM5 rs3824949 and TRIM22 polymorphisms (rs1063303, rs7935564, and rs7113258) were genotyped using the GoldenGate assay. The primary outcomes were: a) significant liver fibrosis (≥F2) evaluated by liver biopsy or transient elastography (liver stiffness values ≥7.1 Kpa); b) sustained virological response (SVR) defined as no detectable HCV viral load (<10 IU/mL) at week 24 after the end of the treatment.

Primary varicella infection results in chickenpox, a contagious rash illness typically seen among children. VZV can reactivate years after the initial infection to cause herpes zoster (HZ) and lead to post-herpetic neuralgia, a common complication resulting in persistent pain that may last for years after the zoster rash resolves. A person's risk of having longer lasting and more severe pain associated with HZ increases with age. Since the introduction of VZV vaccines, the rates of infection, hospitalizations, and mortality have declined. In this review, we discuss in detail current VZV vaccines available for the prevention of VZV and HZ infections. Varilrix (GSK Biologicals, UK), Varivax (Merck, USA) and the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine contain the live attenuated Oka strain of VZV for routine varicella vaccination. While Zostavax is the only HZ vaccine currently approved for use in the United States and the European Union [EMEA, 2011], a subunit vaccine candidate called HZ/su has recently shown improved efficacy for zoster prevention in two clinical trial phase III studies. VariZIG, a post-exposure prophylactic, uses zoster immune globulin to prevent VZV infection in those who have recently been in contact with VZV but lack evidence of varicella immunity and are contraindicated to receive the varicella vaccine. Further, we discuss the skin tropic and neurotropic factor VZV ORF7 gene and its involvement in varicella infection, reactivation and latency in ganglia.

Clinical spectrum in humans can vary from asymptomatic infection to serious organ disfunction depending on the load of parasite, migration target of the larva and the inflammatory response of the host. Transverse myelitis (TM) due to toxocariasis is an uncommon illness identified mainly as case reports in literature. In this report, a case of TM who was diagnosed as neurotoxocariasis by serological findings has been presented. A 44-year-old male patient complained with backache was diagnosed as TM in a medical center in which he has admitted two years ago, and treated with pregabalin and nonsteroidal drugs for six months. Because of the progression of the lesions he readmitted to another center and treated with high dose steroid therapy for three months. After six months of follow up, improvement has been achieved, however, since his symptoms reccurred in the following year he was admitted to our hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed a TM in a lower segment of spinal cord. He was suffering with weakness and numbness in the left lower extremity. There was no history of rural life or contact with cats or dogs in his anamnesis. Physical examination revealed normal cranial nerve functions, sensory and motor functions. There has been no pathological reflexes, and deep tendon reflexes were also normal. Laboratory findings yielded normal hemogram and biochemical tests, negative PPD and parasitological examination of stool were negative for cysts and ova. Viral hepatitis markers, anti-HIV, toxoplasma-IgM, CMV-IgM, rubella-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgM, VDRL, Brucella tube agglutination, echinococcus antibody, autoantibody tests and neuromyelitis optica test were negative. Examination of CSF showed 20 cells/mm3 (mononuclear cells), 45 mg/dl protein and normal levels of glucose and chlorine. In both serum and CSF samples of the patient Toxocara-IgG antibodies were detected by Western blot (WB) assay. Low molecular weight bands (30-40 kDa) were detected in both of the samples by repeated WB testing. CSF revealed more intense bands suggesting local antibody production. Therefore the patient was diagnosed as neurotoxocariasis, and treated with steroid and mebendazole for six weeks. Clinical improvement was detected in the case and thoracic MRI revealed significant improvement in myelitis signs two months after treatment. In conclusion, toxocariasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of TM although the involvement of central nervous system is rare and serological testing should be performed properly in the serum and CSF samples for the diagnosis.","id":"pubmed_content_25","publicationDate":"2016 Jul","publicationIssue":"3","publicationTitle":"Mikrobiyol Bul","publicationVolume":"50","title":"Toksokariyaza bağlı bir transvers miyelit olgusu ve tanıda yerel antikor üretiminin önemi.

Strategically, the MOHFW used both routine immunization centres and educational institutions for providing vaccine to the children aged 9 months to <15 years. The evaluation was carried out to assess the impact of the campaign on MR vaccination and routine immunization services.::METHODS##Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations were done before and after implementation of the campaign. Quantitative data were presented with mean (standard deviation, SD) for continuous variables and with proportion for categorical variables. The overall and age- and sex-specific coverage rates were calculated for each region and then combined. Categorical variables were compared by chi-square statistics. Multiple logistic regression analysis were performed to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of coverage associated with covariates, with adjustment for other covariates. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.::RESULTS##The evaluations found MR coverage was very low (<13 %) before the campaign and it rose to 90 % after the campaign. The pre-post campaign difference in MR coverage in each stratum was highly significant (p < 0.001). The campaign achieved high coverage despite relatively low level (23 %) of interpersonal communication with caregivers through registration process. Child registration was associated with higher MR coverage (OR 2.91, 95 % CI 1.91-4.44).

We determined that conservation, neofunctionalization, and specialization are three main evolutionary processes for Arabidopsis young duplicate genes. We explicitly demonstrated the dynamic functionalization of duplicate genes along the evolutionary time scale. Upon origination, duplicates tend to maintain their ancestral functions; but as they survive longer, they might be likely to develop distinct and novel functions. The temporal evolutionary processes and functionalization of plant duplicate genes are associated with their ancestral functions, dynamic DNA methylation levels, and histone modification abundances. Furthermore, duplicate genes tend to be initially expressed in pollen and then to gain more interaction partners over time.

The goal of this study was to identify the genotypes of rubella viruses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Serum or throat swab samples were collected through the measles surveillance system. Sera that tested negative for measles IgM antibody were tested for rubella IgM antibody. Serum collected within 4 days of rash onset and throat swabs were screened by real-time RT-PCR for rubella virus RNA. For positive samples, an amplicon of the E1 glycoprotein gene was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. 11733 sera were tested for rubella IgM and 2816 (24%) were positive; 145 (5%) were tested for the presence of rubella RNA by real-time RT-PCR and 10 (7%) were positive. Seventeen throat swabs were analyzed by RT-PCR and three were positive. Sequences were obtained from eight of the positive samples.

Sex-differences in immune responses to some vaccines have also been observed, mostly to viral vaccines in adults. Little evidence is available on whether sex-differences occur in response to immunisation in infancy even though this is the age group in which most vaccines are administered. Factors other than sex, such as timing or coadministration of other vaccines, can also influence the immune response to vaccination.::METHODS AND ANALYSIS##Individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of vaccines in healthy infants and young children will be conducted. Fully anonymised data from ∼170 randomised controlled trials of vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, Bordetella pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type B, hepatitis B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and rotavirus will be combined for analysis. Outcomes include measures of immunogenicity (immunoglobulins), reactogenicity, safety and disease-specific clinical efficacy. Data from trials of vaccines containing similar components will be combined in hierarchical models and the effect of sex and timing of vaccinations estimated for each outcome separately.::ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION##Systematic reviews of published estimates of sex-differences cannot adequately answer questions in this field since such comparisons are never the main purpose of a clinical trial, thus a large degree of reporting bias exists in the published literature. Recent improvements in the widespread availability of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials makes it feasible to conduct extensive individual participant data meta-analyses which were previously impossible, thereby reducing the effect of publication or reporting bias on the understanding of the infant immune response.Preliminary results will be available in 2016 with final results available in 2019. No ethics review is required for secondary analyses of anonymised data.","id":"pubmed_content_39","publicationDate":"2016","publicationIssue":"7","publicationTitle":"BMJ Open","publicationVolume":"6","title":"Assessing sex-differences and the effect of timing of vaccination on immunogenicity, reactogenicity and efficacy of vaccines in young children: study protocol for an individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.","url":"http://sfx.stanford.edu/local?sid=stanford:laneweb-search-pubmed&id=pmid:27473951"},{"author":"Lange AE, Thyrian JR, Wetzka S, Flessa S, Hoffmann W, Zygmunt M, Fusch C, Lode HN, Heckmann M.","contentId":"PMID:27473047","description":"::BACKGROUND##Congenital toxoplasmosis is associated with severe complications. German state health insurance covers rubella, but not toxoplasmosis, immunity screening. We analysed the effect of socioeconomic factors on the efficiency of private toxoplasmosis screening during pregnancy.::METHODS##Toxoplasmosis and rubella screening data (n = 5402 mothers) were collected within the population-based Survey of Neonates in Pomerania (SNiP).::RESULTS##At the first-trimester screening, 34.4 % (88.1 %) of expecting mothers were immune to toxoplasmosis (rubella). Susceptibility for toxoplasmosis (rubella) was observed in 39.6 % (8.9 %) and 25.8 % (2.95 %) were not tested. Data on a 2(nd) screening were available in a subgroup of women with negative immunity showing less than 45 % participation rate. Active toxoplasmosis (no rubella) infection was observed in 0.3 % (n = 17) of pregnant women. A multiple logistic regression model (AIC = 719.67; AUC = 0.725) revealed that the likelihood of participating in a second toxoplasmosis screening increased among women with a good level of education and a steady partnership and decreased with paternal unemployment and the absence of breastfeeding. The highest probability of non-participation in toxoplasmosis screening was found among women with temporal burden and family responsibilities. A cost-benefit analysis showed that covering general screening for toxoplasmosis with health insurance saved costs.::CONCLUSION##Toxoplasmosis carried a substantial risk of infection during pregnancy. Although increased socioeconomic status was positively associated with the participation in toxoplasmosis screening, this was not the case when pregnant women had strong temporal burden and family responsibilities. This data supports the need for toxoplasmosis screening among pregnant women as a general healthcare benefit covered by insurance.","id":"pubmed_content_40","publicationDate":"2016","publicationIssue":"1","publicationTitle":"BMC Pregnancy Childbirth","publicationVolume":"16","title":"The impact of socioeconomic factors on the efficiency of voluntary toxoplasmosis screening during pregnancy: a population-based study.","url":"http://sfx.stanford.edu/local?sid=stanford:laneweb-search-pubmed&id=pmid:27473047"},{"author":"Eftekharian MM, Ghannad MS, Taheri M, Roshanaei G, Mazdeh M, Musavi M, Hormoz MB.","contentId":"PMID:27472869","description":"::OBJECTIVES##Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complicated disease which occurs due to relationship between genes and environmental factors that causes tissue damage by autoimmune mechanisms.We investigated and illustrated the hypotheses correlated to the evidence of several putative environmental risk factors for MS onset and progression in this part of Iran.::MATERIALS AND METHODS##Univariate logistic regression was used to detect the effects of environmental factors on the risk of MS.

While the imprinting status of genes is well conserved in mammals, clear estimates for the degree of conservation were lacking in plants. We therefore analyzed the genome-wide imprinting status of Capsella rubella, which shared a common recent ancestor with Arabidopsis thaliana ∼10 to 14 million years ago. However, only ∼14% of maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and ∼29% of paternally expressed genes (PEGs) in C. rubella were commonly imprinted in both species, revealing that genomic imprinting is a rapidly evolving phenomenon in plants. Nevertheless, conserved PEGs exhibited signs of selection, suggesting that a subset of imprinted genes play an important functional role and are therefore maintained in plants. Like in Arabidopsis, PEGs in C. rubella are frequently associated with the presence of transposable elements that preferentially belong to helitron and MuDR families. Our data further reveal that MEGs and PEGs differ in their targeting by 24-nucleotide small RNAs and asymmetric DNA methylation, suggesting different mechanisms establishing DNA methylation at MEGs and PEGs.","id":"pubmed_content_44","publicationDate":"2016 Aug","publicationIssue":"8","publicationTitle":"Plant Cell","publicationVolume":"28","title":"Rapid Evolution of Genomic Imprinting in Two Species of the Brassicaceae.","url":"http://sfx.stanford.edu/local?sid=stanford:laneweb-search-pubmed&id=pmid:27465027"},{"author":"Zahraei SM, Izadi S, Mokhtari-Azad T.","contentId":"PMID:27458680","description":"","id":"pubmed_content_45","publicationDate":"2016 Jul 26","publicationIssue":null,"publicationTitle":"Hum Vaccin Immunother","publicationVolume":null,"title":"Factors affecting the seroconversion rate of 12-month-old babies after the first injection of measles vaccine in the southeast of Iran.","url":"http://sfx.stanford.edu/local?sid=stanford:laneweb-search-pubmed&id=pmid:27458680"},{"author":"Ornoy A, Weinstein-Fudim L, Ergaz Z.","contentId":"PMID:27458336","description":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affecting about 1% of all children is associated, in addition to complex genetic factors, with a variety of prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal etiologies. In addition, ASD is often an important clinical presentation of some well-known genetic syndromes in human. We discuss these syndromes as well as the role of the more important prenatal factors affecting the fetus throughout pregnancy which may also be associated with ASD. Among the genetic disorders we find Fragile X, Rett syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Timothy syndrome, Phelan-McDermid syndrome, Hamartoma tumor syndrome, Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, and a few others. Among the maternal diseases in pregnancy associated with ASD are diabetes mellitus (PGDM and/or GDM), some maternal autoimmune diseases like antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) with anti-β2GP1 IgG antibodies and thyroid disease with anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, preeclampsia and some other autoimmune diseases with IgG antibodies that might affect fetal brain development. Other related factors are maternal infections (rubella and CMV with fetal brain injuries, and possibly Influenza with fever), prolonged fever and maternal inflammation, especially with changes in a variety of inflammatory cytokines and antibodies that cross the placenta and affect the fetal brain. Among the drugs are valproic acid, thalidomide, misoprostol, and possibly SSRIs. β2-adrenergic receptor agonists and paracetamol have also lately been associated with increased rate of ASD but the data is too preliminary and inconclusive. Associations were also described with ethanol, cocaine, and possibly heavy metals, heavy smoking, and folic acid deficiency. Recent studies show that heavy exposure to pesticides and air pollution, especially particulate matter < 2.5 and 10 μm in diameter (PM2.5 and PM10) during pregnancy is also associated with ASD. Finally, we have to remember that many of the associations mentioned in this review are only partially proven, and not all are \"clean\" of different confounding factors. The associations described in this review emphasize again how little we know about the etiology and pathogenesis of ASD. It is obvious that we need more epidemiologic data to establish many of these associations, but if proven, they might be promising avenues for prevention.","id":"pubmed_content_46","publicationDate":"2016","publicationIssue":null,"publicationTitle":"Front Neurosci","publicationVolume":"10","title":"Genetic Syndromes, Maternal Diseases and Antenatal Factors Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).","url":"http://sfx.stanford.edu/local?sid=stanford:laneweb-search-pubmed&id=pmid:27458336"},{"author":"Al-Mekaini LA, Kamal SM, Al-Jabri O, Soliman M, Alshamsi H, Narchi H, Souid AK, Alsuwaidi AR.","contentId":"PMID:27457919","description":"::OBJECTIVES##In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), many vaccine-preventable diseases are notifiable and are often reported despite high estimated immunization coverage.
