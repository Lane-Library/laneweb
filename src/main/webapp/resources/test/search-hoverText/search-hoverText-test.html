                    <li class="hvrTarg">The sensory, motor, educational and emotional/behavioral outcomes in 32 survivors of childhood brain tumors were evaluated
                        by examination, interview, questionnaires on emotion/behavior and the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI 2). Thirty-eight
                        percent had moderate/severe disability, and this was associated closely with special educational provision. Pre- and peri-operative
                        factors were the commonest determinants of disability. Fifty percent had a high score on the emotion/behavior questionnaires,
                        suggesting a high risk of an emotional or behavioral problem. The HUI 2 discriminated well between those survivors who had
                        and those who had not had special provision made for their education but poorly between those with high and those with low
                        scores on the emotion/behavior questionnaires. Previous studies have found self-reported health-related quality of life to
                        be related more closely to emotional/behavioral sequelae than to disability. Possible uses and limitations of the HUI 2 in
                        this clinical context are discussed.
